# This data file contains information used by the kanji generator system.
# For instance, orientation and size information for radicals

# Example entry:

# [[radicals]]
# char = "犭"             -- The Unicode character corresponding to this radical, if any.
# file = "072ad.svg"      -- The path to the SVG file with this radical. Optional if "char" is given.
# pos = 0                 -- Which position this radical takes.
#                            For left or top radicals, it should be 0,
#                            For right or bottom radicals, it should be 1.
#                            This basically describes, in the lists to follow,
#                            which item is this radical, leaving the other for the
#                            combining character.
# x = [0, 28]             -- The x positions for the elements. The "pos" item is the radical.
# y = [0, 0]              -- The y positions for the elements.
# width = [36, 90]        -- The widths for the elements.
# height = [109, 109]     -- The heights for the elements.
# viewbox = "0 0 42 109"  -- The viewbox to use for the radical itself.
#                            The combining character is assumed to have the default viewbox.
